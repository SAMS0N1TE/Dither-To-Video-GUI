## Install Dependencies
```sh 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You need to have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed and only `.mp4` files are supported.
You should place videos in the input folder, but you also do have the options of chosing your own directory. However it defualts to the iput and output folders.
